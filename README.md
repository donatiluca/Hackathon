# P4-Molecular-Dynamics_Neural-Networks 
Molecular Dynamics simulations generate the time evolution of the positions of the atoms of a molecular system over time.
However, events of interest from a chemical-biological point of view, the transitions between metastable states, are only rarely observed, even in very long trajectories. This project aimed to develop new methodologies to determine such events and estimate kinetic physical properties using neural networks.
